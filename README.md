# Xposed.OnePlus2DrawerIcon
Change your app drawer's icon for the one included in OnePlus 2

Here's a little module I created. Pretty straightforward. Install, activate in Xposed and reboot. No configuration, just works. I tested it only on KitKat with Trebuchet, but should work with Stock/Google/Trebuchet Launcher from ICS to KK.
